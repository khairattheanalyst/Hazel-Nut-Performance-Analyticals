**INTRODUCTION**
The objective of this project is to help chocolate brands make data-driven decisions to increase profitability, improve sales distribution and enhance marketing efforts by examining key factors such as sales persons, products sales, country’s demand, revenue, and shipment volume. 

**INDUSTRY TYPE OF DATA**
Food and Beverage Industry. This industry relies on sales data analysis to track product performance, optimize distribution and enhance revenue strategies. By analyzing the global chocolate sales trends, Hazel Nut stores can identify top-selling products, high-demand regions, and key sales contributors to drive revenue growth and improve decision-making. 

**PROBLEMS BEING ADDRESSED**
**Identifying Top Selling Products:** Hazel Nut stores need to know which chocolate products generate the most revenue in order to focus on high-performing items and optimize inventory. 
**Products Performance by Country:** Understanding which country has the highest sales to help the store identify strong markets and potential areas for business expansion. 
**Sales Team Performance:** Recognizing top performing salesperson to increase team performance, implement incentive programs and improve underperforming salesperson and strategies. 
**Seasonal Sales Fluctuation:** Analyzing the quarterly sales trend to predict demand and manage supply, planning marketing strategies and promotions, and overall boosting revenue. 
**Product Demand and Logistics:** Identifying which products have the highest number of boxes shipped helps in refining distribution strategies and ensuring efficient stock management. 
**Underperforming Sales Persons:** Identifying the bottom sales performers in order to provide training and workshops, strategy adjustments, or reassessing team sales efficiency. 
**Shipping and Distribution Insights:** Knowing which countries shipped the most boxes highlights the supply chain strengths, potential logistics challenges, and regional products demand. 
**Overall Revenue Trends:** By analyzing sales revenue trends overtime, HazelNut stores can anticipate and predict future revenue performance and adjust strategies accordingly.

**DATA-DRIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GROWTH**
1. Identify successful strategies implemented in the month of January, and apply them to the rest of the months.
2. We can introduce discounts, limited-time offers, promotions and even new products in the months of February, April and August and in slow months to make up for decline in sales whilst implementing successful strategies from January.
3. We can analyze the trends from the first quarter of the year, see what worked in Q1 and apply similar strategies to the rest of the quarters. Since the third quarter had the lowest sales, we can introduce discounts, promotions and new products in the third quarter of the year to boost sales.
4. We can also plan timely promotions to counter slow sales periods due to external factors like the weather, holidays and so on.
5. We should ensure that there are efficient logistics services in Australia to meet high demand. Seeing that Australia is the best performing country by revenue and by boxes shipped.
6. We can expand our products in India, UK and USA, as they have the next best volume of products shipped. We can have targeted promotions and improve distribution and logistics to further boost sales.
7. We should analyze demand, distribution challenges and marketing efforts in New Zealand to know why their products shipped are low and to improve performance. 
8. We can also improve logistics and marketing effectiveness in the USA to increase boxes shipped.
9. Since Australia generated the highest revenue, we can expand business in Australia, improve distribution, to maintain dominance in the market
10. We need to boost Canada sales growth by identifying the high performing products in Canada and leveraging it. We can also improve marketing strategies, taking notes of Australia marketing strategies and implementing them to boost revenue from its current state.
11. I recommend we improve sales performance in New Zealand. We can take surveys and market research to understand demand. We can also have price readjustments of products and introduce marketing campaigns in order to boost revenue.
12. We should ensure a consistent supply of 50% Dark Bites as it is the most shipped product. We should also optimize logistics to meet high demands.
13. We should also implement campaigns and promotions for the most shipped products to further boost sales.
14. I recommend we analyze the least shipped products for price adjustments and bundling strategies with the most shipped products. i.e 2 in 1 bundles.
15. We should make sure the top 6 products generating the highest revenue should never be out of stock. We can also do ads, and improve marketing strategies for these products to further boost revenue. 
16. Products generating the least revenue can be promoted by bundling it up with the products generating the highest revenue. i.e Buy 2 get one free. This way overtime, they can become independent and boost more sales.
17. We should make research on other factors affecting products generating the least revenue. I recommend we drop some products overtime if they continue to decline in sales and introduce new chocolate brands.
18. I recommend we retain and reward top performers, offering incentives and bonuses to the top performers to maintain motivation and keep the spirit alive.
19. We should provide sales training and workshops for the bottom performers. We can also have a team bonding session where the underperforming sales persons get to work with the high performing sales persons to overall improve team performance. 

**CONCLUSION**
The analysis of Hazel Nut Store’s 2022 chocolate sales data provided valuable insights into product performance, country demand, and sales trends. Key findings include the top-performing products, the most profitable countries, and the salespersons who contributed the most revenue. Additionally, the data revealed seasonal sales patterns and correlations between shipment volume and revenue. While the analysis highlighted significant trends, certain limitations, such as data availability and potential external market factors, should be considered. The dataset’s scope is restricted to internal sales records, meaning external market factors such as economic conditions, competitor pricing, and seasonal demand fluctuations were not accounted for. Additionally, data availability constraints such as missing customer behavior insights may have influenced the depth of the findings. Future research could incorporate additional variables like marketing spend, customer demographics, and competitor analysis to refine strategic decision-making.
Overall, this analysis equips Hazel Nut Store with data-driven insights to optimize sales strategies, enhance resource allocation, and drive revenue growth in future business operations.
